# Hi there I'm Alex 👋

based in Germany, working at [Bayer](https://www.bayer.com) as a Data Steward. I spend a lot of time in the Open Source and Selfhosted area (or in gaming 🎮).

I started coding during school time and ended up more or less in the C# and .Net world. Years ago I worked on a client app for the music server Subsonic, available for Windows 8/10, Windows Mobile and Xbox. 

Right now my biggest project is OpenBudgeteer which is some kind of a selfhosted alternative of YNAB.
